# MIDAS-IIITD_Task_3

flipkart_2.xlsx, flipkart_3.xlsx : A bit a cleaned data, sort of a iteration after cleaning

data_cleaning.ipynb: How I cleaned the data and make it into primary categories.

Predicting_category.ipynb: Implementing different algorithm and performing NLP to predict the category and accuracy. All other details are mentioned in marked down 

flipkart_predict.xlsx: added a column in which predicted row value are there of the algorithm for which we got maximum accuracy.

LSTM/GRU : Performed LSTM/GRU for training our data and evaluating model
